% section 4: brief conclusion
\section{Conclusion and results}

Since we used two different approaches (PyTorch and Fast.AI) we decided to provide two final algorithms: the pretrained resnet-50 (for the PyTorch approach) and resnet-18 (for the FAST.AI). These are the best models in terms of micro-average F1-score.

So, you can find two different models in the GitHub repository:

If we have to choose one solution, according to the results, we will choose the FAST.AI solution.
